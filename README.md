# Healthcare Financing & Immunization Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an **in-depth analysis of global healthcare trends**, focusing on:  
- **COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress** â€“ Analyzing vaccination rollout across countries post-pandemic.  
- **Immunization Coverage** â€“ Examining immunization rates for various diseases and their impact on child mortality.  
- **Financing Healthcare** â€“ Investigating healthcare expenditures, GDP correlations, and financial accessibility.  

- **Live Power BI Dashboard**: [View Here](https://app.powerbi.com/links/h0dWvDvfus?ctid=7bd08b0b-3395-4dc1-94bb-d0b2e56a497f&pbi_source=linkShare)
